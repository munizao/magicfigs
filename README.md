# Magicfigs: Magic Figure Solver

Magic squares are a straightforward application for constrant solvers. Many variations and generalizations of magic squares are possible, and my aim here is to build a collection of modules for solving a wide variety of related problems. In particular, sparse magic squares (where many cells may be empty) will be a focus.

This uses the ortools and more_itertools packages. You can get them with pip.
